# Performance & Architecture

- **Menu Items:** MUST be fetched in a Server Component to ensure zero-JS footprint for the list and optimal SEO.
- **Cart Island:** The shared cart component must be a isolated `'use client'` island.
- **Data Fetching:** Use `Suspense` for loading states while the menu is being hydrated.
- **Images:** Use `next/image` with proper `priority` for the 2-3 menu products to optimize LCP.
