# shadcn/ui Standards

- **Source Code Ownership:** Treat components in `components/ui` as owned source code. Feel free to modify the Radix primitives directly to match Hawks' branding.
- **Accessibility:** Never remove ARIA labels or keyboard listeners provided by Radix.
- **Composition:** Prefer creating "Product Blocks" (e.g., `ProductCard.tsx`) that compose multiple UI primitives rather than massive screen-level components.
- **Tailwind v4:** Use `data-slot` attributes for complex styling instead of deeply nested `cn()` calls where possible.
